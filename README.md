Conceptual Approach:Python--Python--Python. 
                    Python ConfigParser,JSON,datetime modules used for the code.ConfigParser to get or set data into/from .ini                     files.Then used loop and conditional statement to validate the rules and update into txt file.
                   
                   
Complexity:To understand the problem else code writing with exact logic was like a cake walk for me as I deal with JSOn data on 
           daily basis.The hard part was to handle .ini file format as its a first time experience but got good experience.
           
Improvemnet: Graphical Representation of data is more attractive and less time consuming than study of json data.Being a coder 
              we can understand these data easily but for others it would not be an easy way.So in all perspective we should
              prefer GUI representation.We can create graph on hour based data and represent through Grafana or any graphical
              method.
