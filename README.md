Conceptual Approach:Python--Python--Python. 
                    I have used Python-JSON method to read the dump data and then applied loop and conditional statement to 
                    check the rule violations.Then passed those data into file in json format and saved in text format.
                   
Complexity:To understand the problem else code writing with exact logic was like a cake walk for me as I deal with JSOn data on 
           daily basis.
           
Improvemnet: Graphical Representation of data is more attractive and less time consuming than study of json data.Being a coder 
              we can understand these data easily but for others it would not be an easy way.So in all perspective we should
              prefer GUI representation.We can create graph on hour based data and represent through Grafana or any graphical
              method.
